## Syntax
Syntax is very important when you learning programming. If you are comfortable with syntax it makes easy to correct compilation errors and concentrate on logical programming. There is not much syntax to learn in basic Java. Lets recap some of the syntax we have learned.

__Tip:__ Don't remember it blindly. Remember logically ( and also try to think as natural english sentences) and it will be easy

### If
```java
    if(...){

    }
```
__if__ followed by opening and closing parenthesis (__()__) and then code block __{}__

```java
    if( condition which can say true/false (yes or no)){
        // programming statements
        // like System.out.println
        // some statements like x = x+2
    }
```
__condition__ returns true/false (says yes/no)
     
x>0  ( true if the variable __x__ is greater than 0)

x>0 && y<10  ( __x__ should be greater than zero __and__  __y__ should be less than 10 then only it is __true__)

__Tip:__ Read __if__ ( as __is__)
