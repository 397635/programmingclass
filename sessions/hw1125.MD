* Last week we have created a window with 3 panels of each different colors using JFrame, JPanel etc. Re create this with new project. Don't copy and paste from your previous project , but you can refer the code , understand what you did and retype in the new project
* Create new project
    * create class __School__
    * create class __Student__
    * create a method in __School__ called __register__ which takes the following parameters
        * name, age , ssn, grade, address1, address2, phone,
    ```java
            string register(String name, String age, String ssn, String grade, String address1, String address2, String phone){
                // print the student details like registering with name and age
                // return confirmation number something like "1234";
            }
    ```
    * create a method called __register__ now but this time only one parameter whose type is __Student__
    
    ```java
            string register(Student s){
                // print the student details like registering with name and age
                // return confirmation number something like "1234";
            }
    ```
    * See the difference between 2 methods. The second method is taking input of your own data type __Student__ and easy to use this.
    * In main method create __School__ object and call method __register__ and print the confirmation number.

* We are going to create [Tower of Honi](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html)
    * Identity what kindof clases you can think of in this ( hint: don't think of programming, write your classes just plain english)
    * Identity some methods and some properties for these classes.
    * Identify how many objects
