Today we have recapped last week session which are hardware,software,binary system etc.,

We have defined __bit__ which is one binary digit which is smallest data in computer system which can take either 0 or 1. 2 bits can carry 4 values which are 00(0), 01(1), 10(2), 11(3).

   |    number of bits   |  number of values     |   values |
   | ------------------  | -----------------     |----------|
   |     1 (2^1)         |     2                 |   0-1    |
   |     2 (2^2)         |     4                 |   0-3    |
   |     3 (2^3)         |     8                 |   0-7    |
   |     4 (2^4)         |    16                 |   0-15   |
   |     5 (2^5)         |    32                 |   0-31   |
   |     6 (2^6)         |    64                 |   0-63   |
   |     7 (2^7)         |   128                 |   0-127  |
   |     8 (2^8)         |   256                 |   0-128  |

If you see above 8 bits can carry 256 values which are plenty for alphabets+numbers+other characters. All [ASCII](http://ascii.cl/) can fit in to these 256 values. Earlier computers grouped 8 bits and called as __Byte__

   | ----------------------------    | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
   |     8 bits                      |     1 bytes                                                |
   |  1024 bytes    (10^3)           |     1 Kilo byte  ( it is no 1000 as it is exponent of 2)   |
   |  1024*1024 bytes  (10^6)        |     1 Mega byte                                            |
   |  1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes (10^9)|     1 Giga byte                                            |

## Windows OS
  As computer is our tool to develop programs we need to know the details of our computer. We will be learning some basic details and in the future we will be learning some advanced concepts and also other operating systems like OSX , Linux etc.,

  Lets find out what is the memory and hard disk spaces we have on each computer.

  Windows 10 press windows key button  ![windowkey](https://github.com/sairamaj/programmingclass/blob/master/images/windowskey.png) and then start typing __winver__. You will see the below screen. 

![windowkey](https://github.com/sairamaj/programmingclass/blob/master/images/winver.png)

### Memory
  Right click on edit box where it says __Type here to search__ 
  ![totaskmanager](https://github.com/sairamaj/programmingclass/blob/master/images/totaskmanager.png) 

### Hard disk
  Lets find out how much hard disk each one had.
  Press  ![windowkey](https://github.com/sairamaj/programmingclass/blob/master/images/windowskey.png) + E and you wll see the below diagram

  ![fileexplorer](https://github.com/sairamaj/programmingclass/blob/master/images/fileexplorer.png)

  on C drive (you should see on the left side) right click and select Properties

![driveproperties](https://github.com/sairamaj/programmingclass/blob/master/images/driveproperties.png)

![disksize](https://github.com/sairamaj/programmingclass/blob/master/images/disksize.png)

### Question?
  Why we have less (like 16GB on RAM) and high on hard disk (500GB)?

  Recollect about __RAM__ which is used for scratch pad during computer working and __HardDisk__ used for permanent storage like your photos, movies etc., We need higher on hard disk for this items to store permanently.

  ### Folders and Files

  ### Command Prompt

  ### Hello World Java
  #### Eclipse
  



  
  


  go to __Performance__ tab and you should see below one.
