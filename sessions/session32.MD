# Quiz
As promised last class we will be doing one quiz before starting the class. These are the notes for 2 sessions and hence we will have 2 quizs.


## Write program for the below pattern
### The pattern is
  |  Input   |   Output                                       
  | ---------|-----------|
  |    1     |    1      |
  |    2     |    3      |
  |    3     |    6      |
  |    4     |   10      |
  |    5     |   15      |
  |    6     |   ?       |
  |    7     |   ?       |
  |    -     |   ?       |
  |    n     |   ?       |

  If you observe the numbers given input there is output and a pattern exists. The pattern is for the nth number is 1+2+3+4....+n. (for 1 it is 1 and 2 it is 1+2 and for 3 it is 1+2+3 and so on)

  What we need is a program given input number (for now we can put the input number value in the program itself) the output should be printed.

  Before converting to program think about how  you will do in the paper. As you see there is a repetition in pattern we need to use __for__ loop. 
  
  Lets start with above information
``` java
public class Application{
  public static void main(String[] args){
      int input = 3;    // lets start with 3 where we know the output should be 6

      for(int i=1; i<=input; i++){
          System.out.println(i);
      }
  }
}
```
The above program will print as 1,2,3

Now we need to introduce the variable __output__ which can be used in the loop to add the __i__ variable. The program will look like below

``` java
public class Application{
  public static void main(String[] args){
      int input = 3;    // lets start with 3 where we know the output should be 6
      int output = 0;
      for(int i=1; i<=input; i++){
          output = output + i;   // add i to the previous output.
      }

      System.out.println(output);
  }
}
```
variable __output__ will be come like below
  |  i       |   Output                                       
  | ---------|-----------|
  |    1     |    1      |
  |    2     |    1+2=3  |
  |    3     |    3+3 =6 |

finally the output will be __6__.

You can change the input to different values and try.

## Debug
When program written and is not working as expected we call there is a __bug__ in the program which is saying some __error__ in the program. Finding out that error in the program is process called __debugging__. Lets use our __eclipse__ editor to see how a debugging is done.

```java
public class Application{
  public static void main(String[] args){
      int input = 3;    // lets start with 3 where we know the output should be 6
      int output = 0;
      for(int i=1; i<input; i++){
          output = output + i;   // add i to the previous output.
      }

      System.out.println(output);
  }
}
```

when you run the above program it prints the value as __3__ instead of __6__. That means we have a __bug__ and lets __debug__ to find out the problem.

In eclipse double click on the gray bar (on left hand side) on line 6 then  you will see small circle like below

You can also get this by going __Run__ menu and then select __Toggle Breakpoint__ like below
