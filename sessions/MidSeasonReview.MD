Now that we have done 9 sessions lets review where we are , what we have learned so far.

We have started to learn basic Java and some Computer Fundamentals.

# Why Learn a Programing language like Java?
In real life if you want to get some help from your friend first thing is you have to talk to him which involves some common language ( either English, Spanish) and then ask him what you need and then only he can do. In order to to talk to Computer you need a language and there are many just like we have many in real life. Some of the languages you can use to communicate to Computer are __C__, __C++__, __C#__ , __Java__ and there are many more.

## What you can do to Computer using this language
Ok lets see what you can do to your computer which you got from store. You can open a browser and go to your favorite Internet sites. You can open a __Microsoft Word__ program and type your home work essay. You can copy some photos from your mobile phone on to your disk and view them. You can play some songs. Like this you can do lot other things. Did you know these programs (browser, windows word, picture viewer, playing songs) are written by somebody using some language ( may be they are __C__ or __Java__. You don't know but they work). If you want to something new with your computer (like managing your friends along with their birthdays, hangouts etc.,) then you need some language like Java and to do this stuff.

# Knowing more about your Computer
Knowing about your tool which is Computer in this case is more important as you will be using this to your programming. What we have learned in first session is you can divide the Computer in to two parts which is __Hardware__ and __Software__

## Hardware
* Physical parts
    * CPU (Central Processing Unit) (like human brain. This is responsible for everything whether it is simple like doing 2+2=4 or any other big calculations)
    * RAM (Random Access Memory) (like your scratch pad where things are stored temporarily)
    * Hard disk (Things are stored permanently like your photos, videos which exists even if you turn on computer)

## Software
* Programs does some stuff.
* Program = Set of instructions
* Each instruction will some action name and data
* For example you can do some simple program like this
    * wakeup at 6am ( action: __wakeup__ , data: __6am__)
    * run 4 miles ( action: __run__, data: __4miles__)
    * eat breakfast ( action: __eat__)
* You need some master program which can run other programs and this is called __Operating System__ ( like windows, mac, linux)

### Does computer know about your photos, documents, videos?
Basic computer does now know English. All computers know is 1 or 0. Can you believe so many things are done with Computers ( like playing 3D games, videos , your pictures) with just 1 or 0s. For that you need to know binary system which we have discussed in our first session.
