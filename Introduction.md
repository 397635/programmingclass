# Schedule
* We have 22 students for this class. There will be 2 sessions per week to start with and based on how it goes I may increase the frequency. As it is summer and filled with family activities  the classes will be during week days. 
* Tue 8:00-9:30(PM) and Wed 8:00-9:30(PM)

# Students
* Please have a laptop ready for yourself (Either Windows or Mac will work)
* Install Java from here: https://www.java.com/en/download/
* Install Eclipse from here: https://eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/?show_instructions=TRUE
* Sign up a free account at: https://github.com/  ( you will be using class notes, homeworks . Don't worry I will explain next steps in the class)
* Have a notebook and pen for the class.
* If need help outside the classes one can contact me through my email.
* Come with enthusiasm to learn. We will have fun.

# Parents
* Classes will be at 17003 NW Tucson st, Beaverton , 97006 (Looking for other alternatives and will let you know)
* Drop them 5 minutes before the class.
* Class details will be published after each class.
* Encourage them by asking what they learned and does have any home work (Will be light home work as they need to enjoy summer vacation)
* Ping them especially after 2 classes and see whether he/she is ok with computer programming (feel free to drop if there is no interest in going forward for the kid)
* Feedback is appreciated (will publish feedback page)

## Note
  After looking number of classes and the amount of coverage needed to finish the course, I don't think the summer program alone will finish the entire course. My aim is not just to finish the course but make everyone learning comfortable in Basic Java programming. With that said I may continue this in the school year also.

# No classes
* July 12-13
